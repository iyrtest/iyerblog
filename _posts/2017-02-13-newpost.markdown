Welcome to my blog. Here's a sample C++ code snippet to go along with the first blog post.

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

int main()
{
    std::cout<<"Hello, world!"<<std::endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Here's a link to [Google][google] in case you'd like to search the internet. May be you'd prefer [bing][bing] instead? :-)

This part has been modified by prose.io and let's see how this holds up. 

Here's a photo of random something:

Adding code:

{% highlight c++ %}
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;
int main()
{
    cout<<"Using prose for this"<<endl;
    return 0;
}
{% endhighlight %}
